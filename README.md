# Animal-Shelter-Application
My code files and design (with pictures) of the week 5 project. 

To run the animal shelter, open the folder in the terminal and run the app.rb file using "ruby app.rb". 
The website can then be viewed through Chrome by typing http://localhost:4567/Home into the address bar.
